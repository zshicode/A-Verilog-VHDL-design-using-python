# A-Verilog-VHDL-design-using-python

Myhdl turns Python into the hardware description and verification languages, verilog or VHDL, and provides a single platform to test the function of your design. Today we use 2 examples, a delay flip-flop as a sequential logic circuit, and a adder as a combinational logic circuit, to show the convenience using Myhdl to help you design.<br> 
<br>
Therefore, maybe these examples are too simple, sometimes naive, our belief is that the operation of program can be clear if we use a smaller circuit as an example, and our goal is just driving you to be interested in this project. Verilog & VHDL are great inventions for every digital circuit designer, but it's also necessary to provide the beginners with a way which can make the language easier so that they can focus on the theorem of circuit itself, and for those experienced electronic engineers, every action of improving the effeciency is proven to be valuable. Python is an easy-learning language which is more and more popular nowadays, if we can use python to accomplish the goals above, it'll be an exciting big news. And this is what Myhdl is doing.<br>
<br>
This repository gives you the python codes which generated the dff & adder, and for showing the result, we also give the verilog & VHDL code generated by Myhdl based on python. What's more, the 2 png files are vcd form test wave we can see on quartus, and we save them as pictures, so that your guys can view the result more directly.<br>

# A-Verilog-VHDL-design-using-python

MyHDL transforms Python to hardware description languages, Verilog or VHDL, while providing convinient platform to test the design functions. This repository takes a design including two examples, a delay flip-flop (DFF) as a sequential logic circuit, and an adder as a combinational logic circuit.
